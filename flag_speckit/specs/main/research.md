# Research & Decisions

This document records the research and decisions made during the planning phase.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

### 1. Storage Solution

**Task**: Research and decide on the storage solution for the feature flag system.

**Decision**:
- **Primary Storage**: PostgreSQL
- **Caching**: Redis

**Rationale**:
- **PostgreSQL** provides a robust, relational database for storing the feature flag configurations, rules, and audit logs. It's a reliable and widely used database with strong community support and is well-integrated with Spring Boot.
- **Redis** will be used as a high-speed caching layer to store evaluated flags and segments. This will ensure low-latency reads (<1ms) as required by the constitution, by reducing direct database queries during flag evaluation. Changes in flag configurations will trigger cache invalidation.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Using only a database**: This would not meet the low-latency requirements without a caching layer.
- **Using only Redis**: While fast, Redis is not ideal for long-term, structured storage of audit logs and complex relational data.
- **Dedicated Feature Flag Service**: This would be a good option, but the user's request implies building the service in-house.
